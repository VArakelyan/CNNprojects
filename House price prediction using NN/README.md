🏡 House Price Prediction using Neural Networks

This project builds and trains a neural network model to predict house prices based on various features. It experiments with different model architectures, learning rates, and epoch sizes, saving results and plotting losses for analysis.

🛠 Technologies Used

Python 3.x
PyTorch (for training the neural network)
NumPy & Pandas (for data processing)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for plotting results)
Scikit-learn (for model evaluation and preprocessing)

📈 Experiment Results

Best models are identified based on test R² scores after each experiment.
Loss curves are plotted for each experiment, showing training and validation loss over epochs.
